# pipe_snake_game

I wanted to create a snake mini-game using Python and the Pygame library. I reused and edited some assets from the Flappy Bird game to use in the snake game.

My goal was to learn more about the capabilities of the Pygame library by creating a simple game. However, it turned out to be unexpectedly challenging, as I had to take into account different interactions and mechanics. Overall, it was a great learning experience that helped me improve my programming skills.
